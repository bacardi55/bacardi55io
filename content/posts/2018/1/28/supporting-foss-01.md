As said in my [1st post of 2018](/2018/01/12/introducing-my-new-project-pimaton-a-photobooth-app-for-raspberry-pi.html), I decided to "Give Back More" to open source this year and select 3 projects each month to do a donation to them, to thanks these project that helped me in my professional or personal life since my migration to open source software only almost 15 years ago.

As said also, I already have a monthly donation to [La quadrature du net](https://www.laquadrature.net) and I am a member of the [Drupal](https://drupal.org) community too (paid annual fee) but I wanted to do a bit more.

I have in mind these categories and subcategories:
- Tools
  - CLI
  - GUI (I don't use much of them to be honest :)
- Self Hosting
  - Server related
  - Application related
- OS and core software

Each month, I'll pick one for each main category and try to alternate subcategories for Tools and Self hosting.

I don't think these blog post needs to be long, so here we go:

- [Vim](https://vim.org): no word needed here, except maybe that is has been my main text editor and IDE for the last decade, so I owe it so much :]
- [Letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org): Because they made secure self hosting so simple that and it was desperately needed.
- [Raspbian](https://raspbian.org): Having 8 RaspberryPi made this choice almost obvious :)
