Hello everyone!

A very quick post to say this blog isn't dead yet, and I wish you all a happy new year and all best for 2018!


Because I don't like taking new year resolutions (let's face it, I almost never keep them anyway :p) I decided to challenge myself instead (Yeah I stole the idea from my friend juliuss ^^).

My challenge this year is to get back more to open source. Of course I already write a bit of opensource code (specially for [kalliope](http://kalliope-project.github.io/) latelly) but I don't think that's enough. My job is based on opensource and I've worked for more than 7 in opensource now. I think it's time to give back a bit more now that I can by giving small donations every month (at least as long as I still can! --touching wood--) to my favorite or most used opensource softwares. It might be big or very small project, based on daily usage or on an impulse :).
I have a monthly donation for [la quadrature du net](https://www.laquadrature.net/fr) (helps in the "fight" against the devil GAFAM) in place but I think I can do a bit more.

My challenge is to write here every month about the few project I'm giving a bit of money. The beautiful thing about only using opensource for almost 15 years now (wow) is that I have a load of big and small project I love and could donate to.

So that's challenge #1, starting before the end this month!


Challenge #2: Create a photobooth ("photomaton" in French) application and hardware/box for my sister in law's wedding in August.

So apparently renting that kind of thing costs a lot and can not be delivered everywhere. So I said "Challenge accepted"!
I've seen a bunch of similar project on the internet but none where as complete (or cleanly implemented) like I wished… I also wanted to improve my python knowledge by doing more than just some PR for Kalliope… So my idea is to create a simple and configurable tool installable via pip on a raspberry pi that will be able to take picture via the picamera, generate a rendering like in a photobooth (multiple pics on 1 photo), and a lot more. I'll write dedicated blog postS on it (challenge #2.5).



Challenge #3: Improve my domotic and voice commands setup

One of my key focus is to improve and finish my home automation setup, based obvisouly on [Kalliope](http://kalliope-project.github.io/) and [Domoticz](https://www.domoticz.com/) and I'll try to write more about it too :) As the few blog posts show, this has already been a key topic for me in 2017 and should still be in 2018.


Well I think that these are already big for this blog with regards to the small number of posts last year, so I'll stop here :)


Again, best wishes for 2018!
