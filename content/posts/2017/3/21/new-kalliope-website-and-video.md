Today, a quick note to indicate some improvement in Kalliopé with the v4.3 version and it's documentation!

Quick reminder [Kalliopé](https://kalliope-project.github.io/) is personal vocal assistant, so you act like Tony Start… Well almost… :) Well… At least you'll be able to:
- Retrieve data on the web (wikipedia, weather, agenda, email, gmaps, uber, twitter, facebook, RSS feeds, or simply by reading part of webpage)
- Manage a todolist (compatible with todotxt format)
- Listen to music (via an MPD or Mopidy server)
- Manage your domotic simply via http(s), or via device library (Philips HUE) or via a domotic application API (domoticz, LoxSControl)
- Run shell scripts or cli commands
- Get the time of any places in the world
- … And other cool stuff!

And of course, you can add your own neuron and reference it on the [neuron marketplace page](https://kalliope-project.github.io/neurons_marketplace.html) to improve Kalliopé for everyone!

If you haven't seen this video yet, this is a broad example of what Kalliopé can do (video in English):

Great job [Sispheor](https://twitter.com/sispheor) for the demo and the website!

On the [neuron marketplace](https://kalliope-project.github.io/neurons_marketplace.html), look for the play icon ![play icon]({{ site.url }}/assets/kalliope-doc-play.png) for each neuron. If it has one, it means there is a dedicated page and a video to demonstrate the neuron, so feel free to browse :). Most of the videos are in French but some have English subtitles!

But for the lazy, if you just want to browse the video, I created this playlist on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDc8cUmeFkpKdErR5iYTkGJ1-4A05zHIi) with all current videos :)
More video are to come :)


For the occasion, I've also created a dedicated [Kalliopé page]({% link kalliope.md %}) on this blog, where you can find the videos links, my neurons, scripts and all my kalliopé blog posts.

Stay tune for more cool Kalliopé stuff!
