## Kalliope

This is just an introduction blog post for a series of post about the [kalliope](http://github.com/kalliope/kalliope-project), a personal automation tool controlled by voice. The goal of Kalliope is as put on the doc page:

"Kalliope is a modular always-on voice controlled personal assistant designed for home_automation. Kalliope is based on audio input recognition, so it recognize an order pronounced by the user and then execute actions attached to the order."

## Why

Kalliope is an always on personal assistant, so you can use his service whenever it suits you. You just have to active a trigger that will wake up kalliope (eg: "kalliope" or "jarviss", or whatever you'd like).
Once triggered, kalliope listen to your vocal **order** (eg: "what time is it?").

Then kalliope will use voice recognition engine (eg: google voice recognition) to translate your vocal order into a text order. This text will then be compared to the available **[brains](https://github.com/kalliope-project/kalliope/blob/dev/Docs/brain.md)**.

Brains will then triggers neuron that will actually do something (eg: get the time, weather, a definition on wikipedia, call APIs, …) … As we say sky is the limit :)

I encourage you to read [the documentation](https://github.com/kalliope-project/kalliope) that explains all this in much more details.

If you understand french, I encourage you to watch this [very cool demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4J42yO2rkM).
