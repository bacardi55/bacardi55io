Hello again!

I'm re-opening this blog as I have a few things to write on the internet as memo for me and other :)

I'm not going to make a long post for this first post but I wanted to open this blog again to:

- Play with [Drupal 8](http://drupal.org) and the [lightning distribution](http://lightning.acquia.com)
- Put here some notes I found useful to run my workstation on linux
- Talk about cool softwares (like [Kalliope](https://github.com/kalliope-project/kalliope) I started playing with a couple of weeks ago)
- ...

I'm adapting the release early, release often attitude, so I'll update this blog in content and features/design quickly :)

Well, at least I'll try one more time to keep a blog alive (:

PS: some old blog post have been migrated as well as a souvenir of older blog versions...
