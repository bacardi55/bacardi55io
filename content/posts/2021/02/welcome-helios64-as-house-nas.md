As I teased in the article around using sshfs as my new cluster storage, I recently[^1] purchased an [Helios64]() as my first home NAS.

## Why a NAS?

Planned since first article on the first level of backups

## Why Helios64?

### Hardware

### Software

## Installation

### Hardware

### Software

#### Openmediavault

#### RAID


[^1]: Recently received and setup would be more fair, as I ordered it in May I think but received it mid December and set it up early January :)
