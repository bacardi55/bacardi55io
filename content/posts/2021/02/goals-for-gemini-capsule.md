When I [started my gemini capsule](), I quickly put a basic mirror of this blog on it as a temporary thing. I do have a goal to write specific content on my gemini capsule (more reasons on this later).

This temporary version is not good enough at the moment. Links in md are not changed into gemini links and still in markdown format, no listing page for specific content types, lack of flexibility to manage different things on the weblog and gemlog, â€¦

Maybe everything I want to achieve is doable with hugo only, but I couldn't figure out.

My gemini capsule requirements are:
- Full flexibility on the hompage
- Listing and section pages customizable for gemini
- Listing and displaying hugo posts on gemini
- Having dedicated content on gemini
- (Optional: ability to list my gemini post on the weblog but only title and gemini link)
