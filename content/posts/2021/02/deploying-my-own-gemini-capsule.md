I've been following Gemini for a bit of time and as I liked the concept and I love to play with new things, I decided to launch my own gemini capsule (aka, my own "site" on the gemini "web").

## Gemini you say ?

## Installing a server

## Using Hugo to generate your gemini files

## Deploying with rsync
