Hello everyone!

Yes it has been a long time, but as often after a long break writing here, I'm trying to revive it again :) And like usually when I do this, I migrate the blog on another platform… Because apparently why not…

This time I rebuilt it using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Notepadium](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-notepadium/) that I modified a bit. I wanted a new theme for a long time and none on [nikola](https://getnikola.com/) suited me and was too lazy to write my own :D

Anyway, last year was a bit busy, I won't talk about the pandemic and all, but I'm happy that 2020 is over, not saying that everything is already green because it's 2021 but let's start the year optimistically :).

Anyway, let's start with a happy new year to everyone getting lost on this page!

In term of focus for this blog, I'll try to write about my home automation processes. I did start talking about it before but I only touch the installation and not the cool part of the different things I'm doing or plan. Let's see what else comes up in here, we never know^^.
