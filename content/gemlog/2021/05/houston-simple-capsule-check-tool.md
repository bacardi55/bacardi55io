# Houston, a simple tool to check if a capsule is update

I've created this tool very quickly to start 2 goals in one:
* Start learning golang (to try and contribute to other golang project in the gemini space)
* Code something related to gemini

I didn't want to start by trying to understand already complex application for my first go one, so I searched a simple idea to just start somethingâ€¦

Then, I found that I have from time to time an issue with some capsule that works only in some browser. Latest case for me was gemini://cadence.moe/ capsule.

This capsule worked with Amfora, and didn't with Lagrange. I'm not on latest Lagrange version, and that may be why, but it has happened from time to time.

So, just for a bit of fun (and to try cgi scripts for the first time), I thought of an equivalent of downforeveryoneorjustme.com for gemini capsule.

You can [test houston in any gemini browser](gemini://houston.gmi.bacardi55.io)
