## Who am I?

A lazy nerd… So it needs to be written… :-P

You can read [this post about why I'm writing on this blog](/2020/04/25/why-do-i-write-on-this-blog/) to understand me a bit better.

FYI, I am French and not a native English speaker, I apologize for all the grammar mistakes, misspelling and other errors :-).

You can also find the content of this blog on my [gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) capsule here: [gemini://gmi.bacardi55.io](gemini://gmi.bacardi55.io)
